<h3> The Importance of Your Credit Score </h3>

<br>
<br>


<p>
  Today’s economy runs on credit. If you want to get a mortgage for a house or a student loan to pay for college—or if you just want to charge your lunch on a credit card—you’re going to need a lender to extend you a line of credit.
  <br>
  <br>
  You’ll also need to be worthy of that line of credit. Your creditworthiness is defined by your three-digit credit score and is the key to your financial life. Good credit can be the make-or-break detail that determines whether you’ll get a mortgage, car loan, or student loan. On the other hand, bad credit will make it more difficult for you to get a credit card with a low-interest rate and make it more expensive to borrow money for any purpose.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even if you’re not in the market for a loan, good credit can have a major impact. Landlords, insurers, and employers frequently use credit information as a litmus test to see if the people they are dealing with are reliable and responsible. Bad credit can suggest you’re a risky bet, and while your credit technically only shows the details of how you deal with debt, some will extrapolate the characteristics from your financial life to other situations. Good credit can signify that your financial situation—and the rest of your life—is on the right track. This means your credit score can affect your insurance rates, what apartment you’ll be approved for, and perhaps even whether you get that new job.
  <br>
  <br>
  But what is a good credit score?
  Understanding why good credit is important and how to build a good credit score will help you take advantage of the benefits of good credit,  so let’s take a close look at what you need to do to get your score within the “good credit” range.
  <br>
  <br>

</p>

<h4>  What is a good credit score? </h4>
  <br>
  <br>

<p>
  What is considered a good credit score? According to the FICO credit scoring model, credit scores fall into five distinct categories:
  <br>
  <br>

</p>

<h5>
  <ul>  <li> Poor credit: 300-579 </li>
        <br>
        <li>Fair credit: 580-669 </li>
        <br>
        <li>Good credit: 670-739 </li>
        <br>
        <li>Very good credit: 740-799 </li>
        <br>
        <li>Excellent credit: 800-850 </li>
  </ul>
</h5>

<p>
  <br>
  The good credit score range includes all FICO credit scores between 670 and 739. However, many people consider “good credit” to include any FICO score higher than 670. This means that if you have excellent credit or perfect credit, you also have good credit by default.
  <br>
  <br>
  If your FICO credit score is higher than 670, you not only have good credit but have also moved your credit from the “subprime” category to the “prime” category. People with good credit are more likely to benefit from the prime interest rate—which means that you might pay less interest on your credit cards, mortgages, and loans.
  <br>
  <br>
</p>


<h4>  Benefits of good credit </h4>

<p>
  <br>
  There are many benefits to having good credit. Landlords are more likely to rent you an apartment, for example—and if you’re job hunting, you might benefit if your employer reviews your credit as part of the hiring process. That said, the biggest benefits of good credit are all financial. Here are three ways in which good credit can make your life both easier and more affordable.
  <br>
  <br>
</p>


<h4>  Easier credit approval </h4>

<p>
  <br>
  If you have good credit, banks and lenders are more likely to approve your credit applications. This means that when you apply for credit cards, loans, or mortgages, you’ll be more likely to be accepted (and you might spend less time waiting to hear the results of your application).
